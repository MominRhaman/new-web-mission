                    <h1>Mission</h1>
                    <p>As the author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey, says your mission
                        statement
                        is
                        about “defining the personal, moral and ethical guidelines within which you can most happily
                        express
                        and
                        fulfill yourself.” Writing it down on paper makes it real.

                    <h1>Vision</h1>
                    <p>A vision statement is an inspirational statement of an idealistic emotional future of a company
                        or
                        group.
                        Vision describes the basic human emotion that a founder intends to be experienced by the people
                        the
                        organization interacts with, it grounds the group so it can actualize some existential impact on
                        the
                        world.
